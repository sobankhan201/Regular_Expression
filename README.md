# Regular Expressions (Regex)

Regular expressions, commonly known as **regex**, are patterns used to search, match, and manipulate text.  
They are powerful tools in programming for tasks such as validation, text extraction, and string replacement.

## Features
- Match specific patterns in text
- Validate inputs (emails, phone numbers, etc.)
- Extract useful information from strings
- Replace or modify text efficiently

## Example (Python)
```python
import re

text = "My number is 12345"
pattern = r"\d+"  # matches digits

result = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(result)  # ['12345']
Use Cases
Validating form inputs

Extracting data from large text files

Text mining and natural language processing

âœ¨ Regex saves time and effort when working with complex text patterns.
